# Advertising Hexagon

![Advertisement Hexagon Options](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Using a Hexagon for advertisement purposes is relatively straightforward.  First, you can rent out your Hexagon to other people to advertise on.  You can then have multiple people advertise via one hexagon, or just one person advertise via your hexagon.  All of the formalities would be taken care of via smart contracts.  Second, you can upload a form of media to your hexagon to advertise what you want.  Last, you can just reference another hexagon.
