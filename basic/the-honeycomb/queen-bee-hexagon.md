# Queen Bee Hexagon

![Queen Bee Hexagon](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

There will have to be one hexagon for the queen bee.  This hexagon will allow anyone to send 525 $Honey to the Hexagon to mint a worker bee (500 burned, 25 for the owner).  The Queen Bee will have to be placed in this hexagon for one week at the end of every three month period.  If this is not done, the queen bee will die and a new one would be minted and given to a random address with a staked bee.  The owner of the queen bee may choose to put the queen in the hexagon at any time, for any time under three months.  If the queen is in the hexagon for over three months, then it will die and a new one will be minted.
