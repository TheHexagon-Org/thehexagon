# Honeycomb Billboard

The honeycomb is a world of hexagons.&#x20;

Here, people can advertise anything by showing any picture on the hexagons for the purchased period!! People can select from three options:

* 1 day - 10 $Honey
* 10 days - 85 $Honey
* 30 days - 240 $Honey

Once the period is over, the hexagons will be returned to empty unless the advertiser chooses to extend the period with more $HONEY.

To keep the hexagons, advertisers may extend the period with $HONEY.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you keep the hexagons for 30days, you will be able to buy the kept hexagons forever.
{% endhint %}
