# Honeycomb Billboard

The honeycomb is a world of hexagons.&#x20;

Here, people can advertise anything by showing any picture or short clip on the hexagons for the purchased period!! The user may also choose to host a Honey Bee Game in their Hexagon. People can select from three options:

* 1 day - 10 $Honey
* 10 days - 85 $Honey
* 30 days - 240 $Honey

This $Honey is burned.

Once the period is over, the hexagons will be returned to empty unless the advertiser chooses to extend the period with more $HONEY.

To keep the hexagons, advertisers may extend the period with $HONEY.

If the renter/buyer chooses to host a game via their Hexagon, they must pay 100 $Honey per month.  75% of this $Honey will be burned and 25% will be given to a wallet for server fees of the games.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you keep the hexagons for 30days, you will be able to buy the kept hexagons forever.
